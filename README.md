Roblox announced that they will be overwriting the current AnimationTrack:Play() behavior. It used to play the latest played animation without blending the past running animation. However after these fixes, this behavior will be patched. This is a solution for this problem, basically it sets current running animations weights to a very small amount if overwriting is expected. This is my first open source module so if you have some improvements which will be nice to do, you can contribute with a pull request.
